## Overview

By default, all contracts are deployed when running the Anvil instance. This guide covers the following tasks:

- Starting and cleaning the Anvil instance
- Deploying contracts
- Staking tokens with the default account

---

## File Paths

- **Contract Addresses JSON**: `{{ obj.contracts.contractAddressesPath }}`
- **Anvil Database Path**: `{{ obj.dbDir }}`

---

## Setup and Installation

Ensure that you have all prerequisites installed before proceeding (e.g., Bash shell, necessary environment variables). The default setup requires no additional configuration.

---

## Managing the Anvil Instance

### Starting Anvil

To start the Anvil blockchain instance, run the following command:

```bash
bash anvil-start.sh
```

### Cleaning the Current Setup

If you need to remove the existing Anvil database or reset the setup, run:

```bash
bash anvil-clean.sh
```

> **Warning**: Cleaning the setup will remove all current data from the Anvil instance.

After cleaning, restart Anvil using the command in the **Starting Anvil** section.

---

## Deployment

Deploy your contracts on the Anvil instance by running:

```bash
bash anvil-deployment.sh
```

This script will deploy all contracts as specified in your configuration.

---

## Staking

To stake tokens using the default account, execute:

```bash
bash anvil-stake.sh
```

This command stakes `{{ obj.config.defaultStake }}` tokens for the primary account at address `{{ obj.config.primaryAccount.address }}`.
