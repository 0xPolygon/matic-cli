Please make sure you have installed following dependencies:

* Go 1.18+
* Rabbitmq
    ```bash
    sudo apt install rabbitmq-server
    ```
* Npm (Only required on ganache remote machine)
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nodejs npm
    ```
* Ganache CLI (Only required on ganache remote machine)
    ```bash
    sudo npm install -g ganache-cli
    ```

### Usage

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/maticnetwork/matic-cli.git
cd matic-cli
npm i
mkdir devnet
cd devnet
```

#### To setup multi-node local network

```bash
../bin/matic-cli setup devnet -c ../configs/devnet/docker-setup-config.yaml
```

You can find more details about configuration options [here](configs/README.md).

Alternatively, setup a local/remote network interactively

```bash
../bin/matic-cli setup devnet -i
```

Notes:
1. We have provided the default values where ever so to ensure smooth functioning of the process

**After the setup is done, follow these steps for local docker deployment:**

Start ganache
```bash
bash docker-ganache-start.sh
```

Start all heimdall instances (it will run all services - rabbitmq, heimdall, bridge, server)
```bash
bash docker-heimdall-start-all.sh
```

Setup bor
```bash
bash docker-bor-setup.sh
```

Start bor
```bash
bash docker-bor-start-all.sh
```

Logs

Logs will be at `logs/` folder


#### To setup multi-node remote network

```bash
../bin/matic-cli setup devnet -c ../configs/devnet/remote-setup-config.yaml
```

You can find more details about configuration options [here](configs/README.md).

Alternatively, setup a local/remote network interactively

```bash
../bin/matic-cli setup devnet -i
```

Notes:
1. The host machine and remote machine can be any user but path will remain same for installation of binaries
2. The first machine will be used for ganache as well so enter the ETH url as - http://<1st machine IP>:9545
3. Make sure that the host machines has access to remote machines for transferring the data
4. We have provided the default values where ever so to ensure smooth functioning of the process

**After the setup is done, follow these steps for local docker deployment:**

1. Log into first machine and run ganache:
```bash
cd ~/
bash ganache-start-remote.sh
```

2. Log into the remote machines and on each machine run the following steps in different terminals:
```bash
cd ~/node
bash heimdalld-setup.sh
heimdalld start
```

```bash
heimdalld rest-server
```

```bash
bridge start --all
```

```bash
cd ~/node
bash bor-setup.sh
bash bor-start.sh
```

#### Clean Setup

Remove the devnet folder and you can start the process once again
